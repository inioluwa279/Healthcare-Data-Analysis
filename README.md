###
The healthcare waitlist data from 2018 to 2021 has been thoroughly analyzed to provide insights into patient case loads, case types, and waiting times across various specialties. The data reflects the performance and demand on healthcare services over the four-year period. A notable increase in outpatient cases was observed, peaking in 2020, with a subsequent decline in 2021. The analysis also highlights the distribution of cases amongst different patient age profiles and waiting time bands.
## Methodology
###
The analysis was conducted using Power BI as the sole tool for data visualization and interpretation. The following steps were taken:

- **Data Collection**: Data was gathered from annual waitlist CSV files for inpatient and outpatient cases from 2018 to 2021, along with specialty mapping information.
- **Data Preparation**: The CSV files were imported into Power BI. Necessary data transformations, such as parsing dates and handling missing values, were applied to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Aggregation**: Waitlist data was aggregated to identify the total number of cases per year by case type and specialty. Further grouping by age profiles and wait times provided insights into demographics and service efficiency.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards were created to visualize the data over time, by case type, and by specialty. These visualizations allowed for easy identification of trends and patterns.
