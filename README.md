###
The healthcare waitlist data from 2018 to 2021 has been thoroughly analyzed to provide insights into patient case loads, case types, and waiting times across various specialties. The data reflects the performance and demand on healthcare services over the four-year period. A notable increase in outpatient cases was observed, peaking in 2020, with a subsequent decline in 2021. The analysis also highlights the distribution of cases amongst different patient age profiles and waiting time bands.
## Data Scope 
2018-2021
## Metrics Required 
- Average and Median waiting list 
- Current Total wait list  
## Methodology
###
The analysis was conducted using Power BI as the sole tool for data visualization and interpretation. The following steps were taken:

- **Data Collection**: Data was gathered from annual waitlist CSV files for inpatient and outpatient cases from 2018 to 2021, along with specialty mapping information.
- **Data Preparation**: The CSV files were imported into Power BI. Necessary data transformations, such as parsing dates and handling missing values, were applied to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Aggregation**: Waitlist data was aggregated to identify the total number of cases per year by case type and specialty. Further grouping by age profiles and wait times provided insights into demographics and service efficiency.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards were created to visualize the data over time, by case type, and by specialty. These visualizations allowed for easy identification of trends and patterns.

**Detailed Findings**
**Case Volume Over Time** 
###
- **Outpatient cases**: There was a significant increase in outpatient cases from 6,127,911 in 2018 to a peak of 7,061,672 in 2020, followed by a decrease to 1,878,614 in 2021.
- **Inpatient cases**: Numbers remained relatively stable, with a slight increase from 261,646 in 2018 to 268,596 in 2020, and a subsequent decrease to 67,665 in 2021.
- **Day cases**: The numbers increased from 649,936 in 2018 to 654,655 in 2020, before dropping sharply to 174,700 in 2021.
## Waitlist Distribution by Time and Age:
###
- The majority of cases across all age groups were resolved within the first three months.
- There was a noticeable tail-off with longer wait times, with patients aged 16â€“64 being the largest group consistently across all time bands and identifying which periods have had the highest and lowest sales. This information is invaluable for strategic planning, budgeting, and forecasting. It helps me pinpoint when to deploy resources effectively to boost sales or understand the impact of external factors on the company's revenue.

## Visual Representations of Data
###
Since Power BI was used exclusively for this project, visual representations were developed within the platform, showcasing:

- **Trend Lines**: Demonstrating case volume changes over time.
- **Bar Charts**: Breaking down the case types by specialty and wait times.
- **Pie Charts**: Showing the proportion of cases by age profile.
- **Histograms**: Detailing the distribution of wait times across different time bands.
## Conclusion 
### 
The report uncovers important trends and variations in healthcare service utilization over four years. A substantial increase in outpatient waitlists up until 2020 and the prevalence of shorter waiting times across all specialties are key findings. These trends underline the need for healthcare systems to adapt to changing demands and patient demographics. Further investigation into the causes of the decrease in 2021 could be beneficial in planning for future healthcare resource allocation and management
